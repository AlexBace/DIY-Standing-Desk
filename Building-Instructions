Below are the building instrucions for the standing desk:

Supplies you will need:

- 3D printed endcaps (x2)
- 3D printed 90-degree corners (x4) 
- 3D printed 90-degree "tri-corners" (x2)
- 16" long 3/4" square aluminum tube (x4)
- 8" long 3/4" square aluminum tube (x4)

Intrustions:

1. Attach with superglue the 90-degree "tri-corners" to either end of a 16" long tube such that the other the other two inlets of the "tri-corners" are all oriented in the same direction.
2. On both of two corresponding open inlets of the "tri-corners", attach with superglue a 8" long tube to each.
3. Now take another 16" tub and attach a 90-degree corner onto each side such that the the open inlets are facing in the same direction.
4. Attach the newly made assemly from step 3 onto the previous assembly matching the open inlets of the 90-degree corners with the other ends of the 8" tubes.

Note: [At this point you should have a rectangle with two 90-degree corners adjacent to each other and two 90-degree "tri-corners" in the other adjacent corners each with an open inlet facing the same direction]

5. In each open inlet of the 90-degree "tri-corners" attach with superglue two 16" tubes. (these are the legs)
6. On the other, open ends of the newly attached 16" tubes attach with superglue the other two 90-degree corners such that they face inward and don't exeed the plane of the rectangle.
7. Attach with superglue 8" tubes to each of the open inlets in the newly attached 90-degree corner on the legs.
8. Attach the endcaps to the newly added 8" tubes to complete the standing desk.

Congradulations! You have build your own DIY standing desk!
